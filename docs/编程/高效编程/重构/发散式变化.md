# Divergent Change

> *Divergent Change* resembles [Shotgun Surgery](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/shotgun-surgery) but is actually the opposite smell. *Divergent Change* is when many changes are made to a single class. *Shotgun Surgery* refers to when a single change is made to multiple classes simultaneously.

### Signs and Symptoms

You find yourself having to change many unrelated methods when you make changes to a class. For example, when adding a new product type you have to change the methods for finding, displaying, and ordering products.

### Reasons for the Problem

Often these divergent modifications are due to poor program structure or "copypasta programming‚Äù.

### Treatment

- Split up the behavior of the class via [Extract Class](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/extract-class).
-  If different classes have the same behavior, you may want to combine the classes through inheritance ([Extract Superclass](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/extract-superclass) and [Extract Subclass](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/extract-subclass)).

### Payoff

- Improves code organization.
- Reduces code duplication.
- Simplifies support.
