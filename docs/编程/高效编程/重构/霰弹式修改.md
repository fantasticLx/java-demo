# Shotgun Surgery

> *Shotgun Surgery* resembles [Divergent Change](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/divergent-change) but is actually the opposite smell. *Divergent Change* is when many changes are made to a single class. *Shotgun Surgery* refers to when a single change is made to multiple classes simultaneously.

### Signs and Symptoms

Making any modifications requires that you make many small changes to many different classes.

### Reasons for the Problem

A single responsibility has been split up among a large number of classes. This can happen after overzealous application of [Divergent Change](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/divergent-change).

### Treatment

-  Use [Move Method](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/move-method) and [Move Field](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/move-field) to move existing class behaviors into a single class. If there is no class appropriate for this, create a new one.

-  If moving code to the same class leaves the original classes almost empty, try to get rid of these now-redundant classes via [Inline Class](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/inline-class).

### Payoff

- Better organization.
- Less code duplication.
- Easier maintenance.
