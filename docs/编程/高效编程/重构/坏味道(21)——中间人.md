# Middle Man

### Signs and Symptoms

If a class performs only one action, delegating work to another class, why does it exist at all?

### Reasons for the Problem

This smell can be the result of overzealous elimination of [Message Chains](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/message-chains).

In other cases, it can be the result of the useful work of a class being gradually moved to other classes. The class remains as an empty shell that does not do anything other than delegate.

### Treatment

- If most of a method's classes delegate to another class, [Remove Middle Man](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/remove-middle-man) is in order.

### Payoff

- Less bulky code.

### When to Ignore

Do not delete middle man that have been created for a reason:

- A middle man may have been added to avoid interclass dependencies.
- Some design patterns create middle man on purpose (such as [Proxy](http://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/proxy) and [Decorator](http://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/decorator)).
