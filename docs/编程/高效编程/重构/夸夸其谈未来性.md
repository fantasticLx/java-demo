# Speculative Generality

### Signs and Symptoms

There is an unused class, method, field or parameter.

### Reasons for the Problem

Sometimes code is created "just in case" to support anticipated future features that never get implemented. As a result, code becomes hard to understand and support.

### Treatment

- For removing unused abstract classes, try [Collapse Hierarchy](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/collapse-hierarchy).

- Unnecessary delegation of functionality to another class can be eliminated via [Inline Class](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/inline-class).
- Unused methods? Use [Inline Method](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/inline-method) to get rid of them.
- Methods with unused parameters should be given a look with the help of [Remove Parameter](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/remove-parameter).
- Unused fields can be simply deleted.

### Payoff

- Slimmer code.
- Easier support.

### When to Ignore

- If you are working on a framework, it is eminently reasonable to create functionality not used in the framework itself, as long as the functionality is needed by the frameworks's users.
- Before deleting elements, make sure that they are not used in unit tests. This happens if tests need a way to get certain internal information from a class or perform special testing-related actions.
