# Refused Bequest

### Signs and Symptoms

If a subclass uses only some of the methods and properties inherited from its parents, the hierarchy is off-kilter. The unneeded methods may simply go unused or be redefined and give off exceptions.

### Reasons for the Problem

Someone was motivated to create inheritance between classes only by the desire to reuse the code in a superclass. But the superclass and subclass are completely different.

### Treatment

- If inheritance makes no sense and the subclass really does have nothing in common with the superclass, eliminate inheritance in favor of [Replace Inheritance with Delegation](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/replace-inheritance-with-delegation).

- If inheritance is appropriate, get rid of unneeded fields and methods in the subclass. Extract all fields and methods needed by the subclass from the parent class, put them in a new subclass, and set both classes to inherit from it ([Extract Superclass](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/extract-superclass)).

### Payoff

- Improves code clarity and organization. You will no longer have to wonder why the `Dog` class is inherited from the `Chair` class (even though they both have 4 legs).
